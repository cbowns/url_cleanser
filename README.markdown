# URL Cleanser

URL Cleanser is a Safari extension which removes many common tracking variables which web publishers append to URLs. For example, Google Analytics tacks `utm_source` and `utm_campaign` onto the end of URLs, especially from RSS and Twitter feeds. URL Cleanser will get rid of those on page load, without leaving an additional history entry in your browser.

While sites may have legitimate uses for these variables, they're really obnoxious when sharing a link, saving a URL for later, or running an extension such as [Sessions](https://sessions-extension.github.io/Sessions/), which does basic de-duping of URLs, but is defeated by the appending of random request parameters.

This extension allows these requests to go through to the server, but it redirects the browser to a clean URL after the page loads.Many sites do this server-sideâ€“this simply cleans up the ones which don't.

## Using Chrome?

[chrome-utm-stripper](https://github.com/jparise/chrome-utm-stripper) does some of this for Chrome, though only for Google's `utm_*` parameters.
